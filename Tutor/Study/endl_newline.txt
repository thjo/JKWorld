cout << endl inserts a new line and flushes the stream(output buffer), 
whereas cout << “\n” just inserts a new line.
Therefore, cout << endl; can be said equivalent to cout << ‘\n’ << flush; 
Though in some use cases like competitive programming, 
it is better to use “\n” when the problem is not interactive, as it saves time by not flushing the entire line and thus improves the time complexity of the program.
